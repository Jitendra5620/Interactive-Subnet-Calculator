# Interactive-Subnet-Claculator
It is a Network application which is a simple command line subnet calculator that using an IP address and subnet mask given by the user will return five parameters:- 
A. the network address, 
B. the broadcast address,
C. the number of valid hosts per subnet,
D. the wildcard mask and finally,
E. the number of mask bits. 
Finally the subnet calculator should be able to generate one or more random IP addresses from the subnet in which our initial IP address resides.
